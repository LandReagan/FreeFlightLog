Electronic Flight log project:

Big parts: MVC
-Data base management (MVC Controller)
-File management (MVC Model)
-GUI (first release in console mode, then GUI) (MVC View)

All data would be "dataLoadable", virtual class.
Fields would be "dataField" and entries "dataLine"

Database management: class Manager
contains a container of (class) Flights. Let's say vector.
